Default or Zenburn, your choice! :)

By default, Notepad++ doesn't provide syntax highlighting for Markdown.  
I use Markdown everyday, and I'm using a dark theme called Zenburn.  
So, I make one for myself, and share to the world.

If you are a Notepad++ and Markdown user, you may like it!

| Default | Zenburn |
| ![Markdown in Blackboard Theme of Notepad++][screen_blackboard] | ![Markdown in Deep Black Theme of Notepad++][screen_deep_black] |
| Blackboard | Deep Black |

Supports file extensions: `.markdown` and `.md`  
Tested: Notepad++ v7.2.2 (Windows 10)

## Usage

1. Download the Markdown language definition file
	- **Default Theme** : [userDefineLang_markdown.xml][default_xml]
	- **Zenburn Theme** : [userDefineLang_markdown_zenburn.xml][zenburn_xml]
	- **Blackboard Theme** : [userDefineLang_markdown_blackboard.xml][blackboard_xml] :new:
	- **Deep Black Theme** : [userDefineLang_markdown_deep_black.xml][deep_black_xml] :new:
2. In Notepad++ menu, click `Language` and select `Define your language...` .
3. In User Defined Language windows, click `Import` then open the xml file.
4. Restart Notepad++.
5. Open and test with a Markdown file e.g. [test.md][test_file]

**Enjoy!!**

## Limitations

Need your input to solve the following problems:

- `*em text*` only parse the first word because it will screw up unorder list
- `_em text_`, `__strong text__` and `___em strong text___` only parse the first word because it will screw up some URL contains `example__url`

## **\[NEW\]** Beta Is Available For Testing

A complete new version of color scheme is available in branch `feature/emphasis-multiple-words`.

It is going to solve the limitation: Parse *more than one em word*

However, if you use the new UDL file, you will need to change your habbit: **No more \* unordered list**, but you still can use \- or \+ instead.

> :warning: Alert:
>
> The file name and UDL name are same with original. If you overwrite existing file, please download and import to NPP from this (master) branch.

## Build Script for Developers

In v1.1, a build script is provided for your convenience. It will follow the naming convention. It requires `bash` and `mustache.js` to run.

![A Build Script To Help You Build Color Scheme][build_screen]

When you run at the first time:

```shell
# Check if mustache.js is able to run in current bash
mustache -v

# Check if the script works
source build.sh --help
```

Build workflow:

1. Build a new color scheme: `source build.sh [new_name]` (no space, e.g. awesome_dark)
1. The script will create a new json file in a new folder:

	![Build script demo step 2][build_screen_2]

1. In the json file:
	- Change the name according to the theme, e.g. "Markdown (Awesome Dark)"
	- Add your prefered colors in the empty strings, e.g. "FFFFFF"

	![Build script demo step 3][build_screen_3]

1. Build a XML file: `source build.sh [new_name]`

	> tips: Press :arrow_up: to show your previous command.

1. A new XML file is ready to serve in the root directory of this repo.
1. Import in Notepad++ for testing. It's cool, right?

	> tips: Since the old XML is not overwritten, you can prepare two files in NPP.

1. Move the XML file into the corresponding theme folder. Done!
